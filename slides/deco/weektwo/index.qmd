# DECO1: Document engineering concept overview

# What is Diátaxis?

- Diátaxis is a framework for organizing technical documentation.
- It was created by Daniele Procida to address the needs of different documentation users.
- The name comes from the Greek for "arrangement" or "division".

# The Four Types of Documentation

Diátaxis divides documentation into four distinct types:


## 1. Tutorials – Learning-oriented

- Step-by-step guides for beginners
- Help users get started and build confidence

__2. How-To Guides – Task-oriented__

- Recipes for accomplishing specific goals
- Focused, practical, and concise

---

__3. Reference – Information Oriented__

- Technical descriptions, APIs, commands, options
- Precise and complete

__4. Explanation – Understanding-oriented__

- Discussions, background, and context
- Help users understand why things work as they do

# Why Use Diátaxis?

- Organizes content based on user needs
- Prevents mixing of different documentation types
- Utilizes four distinct types: learning-oriented, information-oriented, goal-oriented, and understanding-oriented
- Widely adopted by open-source and commercial projects, such as the development of Linux

# Applying Diátaxis

- Identify which type each doc belongs to
- Structure your docs to separate the four types
- Write with the user's goal in mind
- Review and refactor existing docs using the Diátaxis model
