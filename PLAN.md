# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Create Slides for Week Nine in `slides/nine/index.qmd`

- [ ] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository
that explains the idea of a "Prosegrammer" and the concept of document
engineering. All the slides that you create have to specifically connect
to the theme of prosegramming and document engineering.
- [ ] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the `syllabus` directory of
the repository that explains rules and regulations for this course on document
engineering. Note that these are the rules that students follow and not
specifically the rules and regulations that you follow as a coding agent.
- [ ] The new slides that I want you to create should be in the file
`slides/weeknine/index.qmd`. The purpose of these example slides is to introduce
the basics of Python data containers for document engineering. However, I would
like you to customize all of this content so that it is about using dictionaries
for document engineering. I have only provided you these slides so that you can
see what some introductory slides for my slide decks looks like.
- [ ] You can look at the other slide decks that I have already prepared:
  - `slides/weekone/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weektwo/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekthree/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfour/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfive/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeksix/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeight/index.qmd` and see how I am currently using Markdown and
  Quarto in my slides!
- [ ] Please do not use Markdown or Quarto formats that I am not currently using in
my slides to make sure that the content has a consistent format.
- [ ] Please remember that I am currently working on the slides in
`slides/weeknine/index.qmd` that introduce how to use data containers in Python.
I want the slides to cover these topics:
  - Dictionaries for storing data in document engineering
    - A dictionary that maps document IDs to document content
    - Dictionaries that have key-value pairs of different types
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to a string
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to an integer
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to a list
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to another dictionary
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to a tuple
      - Dictionary that uses a string to map to a set
  - Reading in a JSON file and parsing it into a dictionary
  - Make sure that all work with JSON files uses only packages that are part of
  the standard Python library.
  - Do not use any external libraries when in the code that you implement.
  - Any other basic content about dictionaries, including:
    - Creating and initializing a dictionary
    - Accessing a key or a value in a dictionary
    - Iterating through the keys or the values in a dictionary
    - Adding and removing elements from a dictionary
- [ ] Make sure 
- [ ] If you check the `index.qmd` file in this GitHub repository, you can see a
simple example of word frequency analysis. Please use simple examples like this
one to illustrate how to use containers like lists, tuples, and sets in Python.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content is accessible to beginners who do not have
extensive experience with programming or the documentation of a software tool.
- [ ] Make sure that all the content has concrete examples that make points
clear to beginners. Provide simple summaries of the concrete code examples.
