# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Revise the Index for the Entire Site

- [ ] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [ ] Rewrite each of the introductory paragraphs so that they focus on the
concept of a "Prosegrammer". 
- [ ] Rewrite the course overview so that it connects to the concept
of a "Prosegrammer" and a course on document engineering
- [ ] Create a new Python source code example that connects to the
topic of document engineering and does not require any dependencies.
- [ ] Delete any content related to performance engineering, as this is not
the focus of a course on document engineering.
- [ ] Give the correct link to the discord server, which is specified in
the `_quarto.yml` file.
