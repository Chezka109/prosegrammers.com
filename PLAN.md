# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Create Slides for Week Nine in `slides/nine/index.qmd`

- [X] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [X] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the root of the repository
that explains the idea of a "Prosegrammer" and the concept of document
engineering.
- [X] Review the content in the `index.qmd` file in the `syllabus` directory of
the repository that explains rules and regulations for this course on document
engineering. Note that these are the rules that students follow and not
specifically the rules and regulations that you follow as a coding agent.
- [X] The new slides that I want you to create should be in the file
`slides/weekeight/index.qmd`. The purpose of these slides is to introduce the
basics of Python data containers for document engineering. I previously created
these slides for a course on Algorithm Analysis. However, I would like you to
customize all of this content for document engineering.
- You can look at the other slide decks that I have already prepared:
  - `slides/weekone/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weektwo/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekthree/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfour/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekfive/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weeksix/index.qmd`
  - `slides/weekeight/index.qmd`
  and see how I am currently using Markdown and Quarto in my slides!
- Please do not use Markdown or Quarto formats that I am not currently
using in my slides to make sure that the content has a consistent format.
- [X] Please remember that I am currently working on the slides in
`slides/weeknine/index.qmd` that introduce how to use data containers in
Python. I want the slides to cover these topics:
  - Lists (single-dimensional and two-dimensional)
    - A single-dimensional list that stores five different documents
    - A two-dimensional list that stores a list of the same document
      but with different metadata or arising from different formats
  - Tuples and sets
    - A tuple that stores the title, author, and date of a document
    - A set that stores the unique keywords or tags associated with a document
  - Any other basic content about lists, sets, or tuples, including:
    - Creating and initializing lists, tuples, and sets
    - Accessing elements in lists, tuples, and sets
    - Adding and removing elements from lists, tuples, and sets

- [X] If you check the `index.qmd` file in this GitHub repository, you can see a
simple example of word frequency analysis. Please use simple examples like this
one to illustrate how to use containers like lists, tuples, and sets in Python.
- [X] Make sure that all the content is accessible to beginners who do not have
extensive experience with programming or the documentation of a software tool.
- [X] Make sure that all the content has concrete examples that make points
clear to beginners. Provide simple summaries of the concrete code examples.
