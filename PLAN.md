# Plan for Prosegrammers

## Plan for Content

### Revise the Index for the Entire Site

- [ ] Review the content in the `GEMINI.md` file (or the `AGENTS.md` file) that
explains the theme of the course on document engineering.
- [ ] Rewrite each of the introductory paragraphs so that they focus on the
concept of a "Prosegrammer". 
- [ ] Rewrite the course overview so that it connects to the concept
of a "Prosegrammer" and a course on document engineering
- [ ] Create a new Python source code example that connects to the
topic of document engineering and does not require any dependencies.
- [ ] Delete any content related to performance engineering, as this is not
the focus of a course on document engineering.
- [ ] Give the correct link to the discord server, which is specified in
the `_quarto.yml` file.

### Support for Index.qmd Revision Content

#### Definition and Etymology of "Prosegrammer"

- The term "prosegrammer" effectively combines "prose" (written text) and
"programmer" (software developer)
- This portmanteau reflects the interdisciplinary nature of document engineering
- Similar compound terms exist in technical fields (e.g., "bioinformatics"
combines biology and informatics)

#### Document Engineering as Academic Field

- Document engineering is recognized as a legitimate academic discipline
combining computer science and technical communication
- Research in this field includes automated document generation, content
management systems, and text analytics
- Universities offer courses in technical writing, computational linguistics,
and information design that align with document engineering principles

#### Python for Document Processing

- Python's string manipulation capabilities, regex support, and libraries like
NLTK make it ideal for document analysis
- The `string` module provides built-in methods for text cleaning and processing
- Dictionary-based word frequency analysis is a standard technique in natural
language processing and computational linguistics

#### Document Analysis Metrics

- Word count, sentence count, and readability metrics are standard measures in
content analysis
- The Flesch-Kincaid readability score and similar metrics rely on
words-per-sentence calculations
- Document summary statistics help technical writers assess and improve content
quality
